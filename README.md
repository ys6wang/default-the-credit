# default-the-credit
## A model to forecast the probability that a customer will default can especially help commercial banks reduce costs by accepting less risky customer loans. On the other hand, it can also help to define the correct interest rates depending on the specific risks of each client, based on their probability of default. In this model, we developed a model with features of the clients to predict whether the customer will default or not to reduce to cost generated by customer defaults.
